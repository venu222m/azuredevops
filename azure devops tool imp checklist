Azure DevOps – Key Areas for DevOps Engineer Role
✅ 1. Pipelines (CI/CD) 🔥
Why Important: Core of automation in DevOps – build, test, deploy.

Azure Pipelines: Learn YAML vs Classic UI pipelines.

Build Pipelines: Automate code build + test.

📘 Example: Compile a .NET app, run unit tests.

Release Pipelines: Deploy to dev/test/prod environments.

📘 Example: Deploy container to AKS or VM using ARM/Terraform.

✅ 2. Agent Pools
Why Important: Custom agents required for Terraform, Ansible, Docker, etc.

Understand Hosted vs Self-Hosted agents.

📘 Example: Add self-hosted agent with Docker, Terraform installed.

✅ 3. Service Connections
Why Important: Required to connect pipelines to Azure, AWS, GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.

📘 Example: Create a service connection for Azure subscription to deploy ARM/Bicep/Terraform.

👤 Project Settings – Must Know
✅ 4. Repositories
Why Important: Stores your code and pipeline definitions.

Understand Git basics, branching, pull requests.

📘 Example: Use Azure Repo Git for app + infra-as-code (Terraform) together.

✅ 5. Artifacts (Storage)
Why Important: Used for storing build outputs (.zip, .jar, Docker images).

📘 Example: Store a .NET package after build and use it in deployment.

✅ 6. Parallel Jobs
Why Important: To run multiple pipeline stages/jobs in parallel (paid feature after 1 free job).

📘 Example: Run unit tests + security scan at same time.

🔐 Security & Integration
✅ 7. Permissions (both User & Project level)
Why Important: Manage access to pipelines, repos, environments.

📘 Example: Give access only to QA team to deploy to QA environment.

✅ 8. Service Hooks
Why Important: Automate actions between Azure DevOps and tools like Slack, Jira, Teams.

📘 Example: Send a message to MS Teams when deployment fails.

✅ 9. Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
Why Important: Used to authenticate CLI, scripts, or external tools.

📘 Example: Use PAT to trigger a pipeline from external Jenkins job.

📈 Monitoring & Testing
✅ 10. Test Management
Why Important: Track manual & automated test cases in DevOps.

📘 Example: Link automated Selenium tests from Azure Pipelines.

✅ 11. Retention
Why Important: Manage storage costs by setting retention policies on builds, logs, and artifacts.

⚙️ User Profile Settings (for daily use)
Notifications: Setup alerts on pipeline status.

SSH Public Keys: Connect to Git repo securely.

Theme/Usage: Optional, but know where it is.
