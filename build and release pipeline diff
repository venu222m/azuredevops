Hereâ€™s a clear explanation of the difference between a Build Pipeline and a Release Pipeline in Azure DevOps, with real-world DevOps context:

ðŸ”§ 1. What is a Build Pipeline?
Build Pipeline (also called CI Pipeline):

It compiles, builds, packages, and tests your source code.

Main goal: convert code into artifacts (e.g., .jar, .zip, .docker image, etc.)

Common tools used: MSBuild, Maven, Gradle, Docker, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
You push code to GitHub or Azure Repos â†’ Azure DevOps triggers a build pipeline â†’ It compiles the code, runs unit tests, and creates a .jar file â†’ Publishes it as an artifact.

ðŸ§± Typical Steps in a Build Pipeline:
yaml
Copy
Edit
- Checkout code
- Install dependencies
- Compile/build code
- Run unit tests
- Publish build artifact (e.g., app.zip)
ðŸš€ 2. What is a Release Pipeline?
Release Pipeline (also called CD Pipeline):

It deploys the artifacts (from the build pipeline) to various environments: Dev, QA, Staging, Production, etc.

You can add manual approvals, gates, and deployment strategies (blue/green, canary).

It can include infrastructure steps, Ansible/Terraform, or Kubernetes deploys.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
Build pipeline produces webapp.zip â†’ Release pipeline picks that artifact â†’ Deploys to a VM or App Service â†’ Promotes to staging â†’ After approval, deploys to production.

ðŸ§± Typical Steps in a Release Pipeline:
diff
Copy
Edit
- Download build artifact
- Deploy to Dev environment
- Run integration tests
- Deploy to Staging (with approval)
- Deploy to Production (after approval)
ðŸ”„ Relationship Between Build and Release Pipelines
Build Pipeline (CI)	Release Pipeline (CD)
Builds the application	Deploys the application
Triggered by code commits	Triggered by successful builds
Outputs artifacts (e.g., .jar, .zip)	Takes artifacts and deploys to environments
Focuses on code quality/testing	Focuses on delivery and infrastructure

              [Release Pipeline]
    (Deploy to Dev â†’ QA â†’ Staging â†’ Prod)
ðŸ§ª Real-World Example: Docker App
Build Pipeline:

Clone repo

Build Docker image

Push to ACR (Azure Container Registry)

Publish artifact (like image tag or Helm chart)

Release Pipeline:

Pull Docker image from ACR

Deploy to AKS (Kubernetes)

Run post-deploy smoke tests

Send Slack/Email notification

âœ… Summary Table
Feature	Build Pipeline (CI)	Release Pipeline (CD)
Goal	Build & test code	Deploy artifacts to environments
Trigger	Code commit, PR	Build completion or manual
Output	Artifacts (e.g., .jar, Docker img)	Deployments
Environments	Typically N/A	Dev, QA, Staging, Production
Common tools	Maven, Gradle, Docker	Terraform, Ansible, Azure CLI, Helm
Manual Approvals	Rare	Common before Prod
