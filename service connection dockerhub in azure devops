create that service connection in Azure DevOps first.

Here’s the step-by-step to create it:

1. Go to Project Settings

In your Azure DevOps project, scroll down to the bottom-left corner.

Click ⚙ Project Settings.

2. Create a New Service Connection

In Pipelines → Service connections, click New service connection.

From the list, choose Docker Registry.

In the popup:

Registry type: Select Docker Hub.

Docker ID: Your Docker Hub username.

Password or access token:

Either your Docker Hub password, or better — create a Docker Hub access token and use it here.

Service connection name: Example — dockerHubConnection.

Tick Grant access permission to all pipelines.

Click Verify and save.
