âœ… Real-Time Tasks Using Azure DevOps (3.5+ Years Experience)
Task	Description
Code Repository Management	Manage source code with Azure Repos (Git)
CI/CD Pipelines	Automate build & deployment with Azure Pipelines
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)	Use pipelines to deploy Terraform/ARM templates
Release Management	Create approvals, gates, and environments
Artifact Management	Store, version, and share build artifacts
Secrets Management	Use Azure Key Vault integration
Testing Automation	Run unit/integration tests in CI pipelines
Monitoring & Alerts	Integrate with Azure Monitor or App Insights
Multi-stage Pipelines	Use YAML to define dev, staging, and prod stages

ðŸ§° Common Azure DevOps CLI Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
# Login to Azure DevOps
az devops login

# Set default organization/project
az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/YourOrg project=YourProject

# List pipelines
az pipelines list

# Run a pipeline
az pipelines run --name "BuildPipeline"

# View pipeline runs
az pipelines runs list --pipeline-name "BuildPipeline"

# Create variable group
az pipelines variable-group create --name "SecretsGroup" --variables key1=value1 key2=value2
ðŸ’¡ Azure DevOps Real-World Use Cases
Use Case	Description
Deploy Azure Infrastructure	Use Terraform/ARM templates in pipeline
Deploy Web App to Azure VM/App Service	Automate via build + release pipelines
Integrate with GitHub	Trigger pipeline on GitHub push/PR
Store Docker images	Use Azure Container Registry + publish via pipeline
Hybrid Cloud Deployments	Use self-hosted agents in on-prem/cloud mix
Secret Injection	Secure access to Azure Key Vault during builds
Canary/Blue-Green Deployment	Set up deployment slots and approval gates
Testing	Integrate with Selenium, Postman, or API testing tools

ðŸŽ¯ Top Azure DevOps Interview Q&A (SRE/DevOps 3.5+ Yrs)
âœ… Q1: What are the main components of Azure DevOps?
A:

Azure Repos (Git)

Azure Pipelines (CI/CD)

Azure Boards (Agile project tracking)

Azure Test Plans

Azure Artifacts

âœ… Q2: How do you set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps?
A:

Connect Azure Repos/GitHub repo

Define pipeline in YAML (azure-pipelines.yml)

Configure build tasks (restore, build, test)

Define release stages (dev, test, prod)

Add approvals/gates where needed

âœ… Q3: Whatâ€™s the difference between Classic and YAML pipelines?
Classic Pipeline	YAML Pipeline
UI-based	Code-defined
Less reusable	Reusable templates
Not version-controlled	Stored in repo with source code

âœ… Q4: What is a self-hosted agent?
A:
A custom machine (VM or physical) where Azure DevOps pipeline tasks run. Useful for installing custom tools or accessing private networks.

âœ… Q5: How do you secure secrets in Azure DevOps pipelines?
A:

Use Variable Groups (secret variables)

Integrate with Azure Key Vault

Reference secrets using $(SecretName)

âœ… Q6: How can you deploy infrastructure using Azure DevOps?
A:
Use IaC tools like:

Terraform in pipeline:

yaml
Copy
Edit
- script: terraform init && terraform apply -auto-approve
Or ARM/Bicep templates via az deployment commands

âœ… Q7: How do you trigger pipelines?
A:

On push, PR, or schedule using triggers in YAML

yaml
Copy
Edit
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
âœ… Q8: How do you manage approvals and environments?
A:

Use Environments in release pipelines

Add pre-deployment approvals

Add checks like Azure Monitor or manual intervention

âœ… Q9: What is the purpose of Azure Artifacts?
A:
Host and manage private NuGet, npm, Maven, or Python packages, useful in enterprise CI/CD workflows.

âœ… Q10: How do you integrate testing in Azure DevOps?
A:

Add test tasks in build stage (e.g., dotnet test, pytest)

Publish test results using PublishTestResults@2

Use test plans for manual/exploratory testing

ðŸ“Œ Azure DevOps Resume Points (3.5+ Yrs)
Implemented CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps to automate application and infrastructure deployments.

Integrated Azure Repos with YAML pipelines for Git-based deployments across dev, staging, and prod.

Deployed Azure infrastructure using Terraform modules and Azure CLI tasks in pipelines.

Configured pipeline approvals, gates, and secrets management using Azure Key Vault.
