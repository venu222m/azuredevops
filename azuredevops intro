Here's a step-by-step Azure DevOps learning guide tailored for DevOps Engineers (3+ years experience) — covering both theory and hands-on with pipelines, repos, deployments, and real-world scenarios.

✅ What is Azure DevOps?
Azure DevOps is a set of development tools and services for:

Source code management (Repos)

Continuous Integration/Delivery (Pipelines)

Work tracking (Boards)

Artifacts (packages)

Testing (Test Plans)

🧭 Azure DevOps Step-by-Step Learning Roadmap
🧩 Phase 1: Understand Core Concepts
Topic	Details
✅ What is DevOps?	CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, Agile methodology
✅ Azure DevOps Overview	Services: Repos, Pipelines, Boards, Artifacts, Test Plans
✅ Project Structure	Organization → Project → Repo/Pipeline/Board/etc.

🧩 Phase 2: Set Up Azure DevOps Account
Go to: https://dev.azure.com

Sign in with Microsoft account

Create a new Organization

Create a Project

🧩 Phase 3: Work with Azure Repos (Git)
Create a Repo

Clone it to local using Git CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_git/your-repo
Add files and push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push origin main
🔁 Learn Git commands: clone, branch, merge, pull request, revert

🧩 Phase 4: Build Pipelines (CI)
✅ Classic Pipeline (GUI):

Go to Pipelines → Create Pipeline → Use Classic Editor

Select Repo → Choose agent (e.g., Ubuntu)

Add Tasks:

Install dependencies

Build (e.g., Maven, .NET, npm)

Publish artifacts

✅ YAML Pipeline (Code-based):

yaml
Copy
Edit
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: echo "Building project"
- script: dotnet build
- script: dotnet test
✅ Push azure-pipelines.yml to repo

🧩 Phase 5: Release Pipelines (CD)
Go to Releases

Create a new release pipeline

Add Artifact → from build pipeline

Add Stages (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod)

Add tasks: Copy files, Deploy to VM, AKS, App Service

Enable approvals and gates

🧩 Phase 6: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
✅ Integrate Terraform, ARM/Bicep, or Ansible:

yaml
Copy
Edit
steps:
- script: terraform init
- script: terraform plan
- script: terraform apply -auto-approve
🧩 Phase 7: Work Tracking with Boards
Use Boards to manage Epics, Features, Stories, Bugs

Use Sprints and Backlogs

Track with Kanban boards

🧩 Phase 8: Use Azure Artifacts
Go to Artifacts

Create a new feed

Push packages: NuGet, npm, Maven, Python

🧩 Phase 9: Security & Service Connections
Create Service Connections for:

Azure (ARM)

GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.

🔐 Role-based access: Contributors, Readers, Admins

🎓 Final Phase: Real-Time Project Practice
Scenario	Tools Involved
Build & Deploy Java App on VM	Repos, Pipelines, SSH task, Maven
Deploy Python App to Azure App Service	YAML pipeline, AzureWebApp task
Terraform Infra Deployment	Terraform CLI + Azure CLI + Pipelines
Helm Deploy to AKS	Helm, kubectl, Service Connection (AKS)
CI/CD with Approval	Staged release pipeline with manual approvals
