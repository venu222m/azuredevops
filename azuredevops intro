Here's a step-by-step Azure DevOps learning guide tailored for DevOps Engineers (3+ years experience) — covering both theory and hands-on with pipelines, repos, deployments, and real-world scenarios.

✅ What is Azure DevOps?
Azure DevOps is a set of development tools and services for:

Source code management (Repos)

Continuous Integration/Delivery (Pipelines)

Work tracking (Boards)

Artifacts (packages)

Testing (Test Plans)

🧭 Azure DevOps Step-by-Step Learning Roadmap
🧩 Phase 1: Understand Core Concepts
Topic	Details
✅ What is DevOps?	CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, Agile methodology
✅ Azure DevOps Overview	Services: Repos, Pipelines, Boards, Artifacts, Test Plans
✅ Project Structure	Organization → Project → Repo/Pipeline/Board/etc.

🧩 Phase 2: Set Up Azure DevOps Account
Go to: https://dev.azure.com

Sign in with Microsoft account

Create a new Organization

Create a Project

🧩 Phase 3: Work with Azure Repos (Git)
Create a Repo

Clone it to local using Git CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_git/your-repo
Add files and push:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push origin main
🔁 Learn Git commands: clone, branch, merge, pull request, revert

🧩 Phase 4: Build Pipelines (CI)
✅ Classic Pipeline (GUI):

Go to Pipelines → Create Pipeline → Use Classic Editor

Select Repo → Choose agent (e.g., Ubuntu)

Add Tasks:

Install dependencies

Build (e.g., Maven, .NET, npm)

Publish artifacts

✅ YAML Pipeline (Code-based):

yaml
Copy
Edit
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- script: echo "Building project"
- script: dotnet build
- script: dotnet test
✅ Push azure-pipelines.yml to repo

🧩 Phase 5: Release Pipelines (CD)
Go to Releases

Create a new release pipeline

Add Artifact → from build pipeline

Add Stages (e.g., Dev, QA, Prod)

Add tasks: Copy files, Deploy to VM, AKS, App Service

Enable approvals and gates

🧩 Phase 6: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
✅ Integrate Terraform, ARM/Bicep, or Ansible:

yaml
Copy
Edit
steps:
- script: terraform init
- script: terraform plan
- script: terraform apply -auto-approve
🧩 Phase 7: Work Tracking with Boards
Use Boards to manage Epics, Features, Stories, Bugs

Use Sprints and Backlogs

Track with Kanban boards

🧩 Phase 8: Use Azure Artifacts
Go to Artifacts

Create a new feed

Push packages: NuGet, npm, Maven, Python

🧩 Phase 9: Security & Service Connections
Create Service Connections for:

Azure (ARM)

GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.

🔐 Role-based access: Contributors, Readers, Admins

🎓 Final Phase: Real-Time Project Practice
Scenario	Tools Involved
Build & Deploy Java App on VM	Repos, Pipelines, SSH task, Maven
Deploy Python App to Azure App Service	YAML pipeline, AzureWebApp task
Terraform Infra Deployment	Terraform CLI + Azure CLI + Pipelines
Helm Deploy to AKS	Helm, kubectl, Service Connection (AKS)
CI/CD with Approval	Staged release pipeline with manual approvals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Azure DevOps, there are five core components you should focus on — especially as a DevOps Engineer working on CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and cloud deployments.

✅ Azure DevOps Core Components to Learn
Component	Description	Key Use Cases / Concepts
1. Azure Repos	Git-based source code repositories	- Version control for code, Terraform, ARM, scripts
- Branching, PRs, code review
2. Azure Pipelines	CI/CD pipelines for build and release automation	- Build/Test/Deploy using YAML or Classic UI
- Multi-stage pipelines
3. Azure Boards	Work tracking, task management, Agile boards	- Backlog, Epics, Features, User Stories, Sprints
4. Azure Artifacts	Package management (NuGet, npm, Maven, etc.)	- Store and share build artifacts like .zip, .jar, .nupkg, etc.
5. Azure Test Plans	Manual and exploratory testing platform	- Manual tests, test suites, test plans (less used in automation-heavy environments)

🎯 As a DevOps Engineer — Focus on These in Depth:
🔹 Azure Repos
Clone/Pull/Push via Git

Branching strategy (main/dev/release)

Pull requests (PR) + code review process

🔹 Azure Pipelines (Top Priority)
YAML-based pipelines

Multi-stage (Build + Release)

Use Terraform, Ansible, Shell Script inside pipeline

Pipeline Variables, Secret Variables

Azure CLI / PowerShell tasks

Service Connections (for Azure Resource Manager)

Integration with Docker, Kubernetes, AKS, ACR

🔹 Azure Artifacts
Publishing and consuming build outputs

Artifact sharing between stages

🔹 Azure Boards (Basic Only)
Track your tasks and defects

Link commits/PRs to work items

💡 Real-Time Examples for Practice
Task	Tool Used	Example
VM Deployment using Terraform	Repos + Pipelines	Code in repo, CI pipeline triggers Terraform apply
App Build and Deploy to App Service	Repos + Pipelines	Node.js/Java app with CI/CD YAML pipeline
Docker Image Push to ACR	Pipelines	Use Docker task + login to ACR
Track project progress	Boards	Create epics > features > stories > tasks
Store artifacts between stages	Artifacts	Upload WAR files or zip to share between build and release

🧠 Tips for Learning
Start with Pipelines YAML (must-know)

Practice with Terraform or ARM templates

Use Azure CLI task inside pipeline for cloud operations

Learn how to connect Azure DevOps to Azure using Service Principal

Keep one project repo for testing full end-to-end flow

✅ Suggested Learning Path
Setup Azure DevOps project

Create Repo with Terraform or Web App code

Write a multi-stage YAML Pipeline

Add a Service Connection (SP)

Deploy a VM or App Service

Track work in Azure Boards
