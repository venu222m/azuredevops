 Azure DevOps Engineer Checklist â€“ 2025 Edition
ðŸ”¹ 1. Azure DevOps Services (Core CI/CD Tools)
 Azure Repos â€“ Git repo management (clone, commit, PRs, branch policies)

 Azure Pipelines â€“ YAML-based CI/CD for:

App deployment to VMs, AKS, Azure App Service

Docker builds and push to ACR

 Azure Artifacts â€“ Package management (NuGet, npm, Maven)

 Service Connections â€“ Connect to Azure, GitHub, Docker Hub

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Build a CI pipeline for a .NET app that builds, runs tests, and deploys to Azure App Service.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Azure Infrastructure (Core Services)
 Azure VMs â€“ Provisioning, access control, extensions, automation

 Virtual Network, NSGs, Load Balancer

 Azure Storage â€“ Blob, file share, and lifecycle rules

 Azure Key Vault â€“ Secure secrets, integrate with DevOps pipelines

 Azure App Services / Web Apps

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Use ARM or Terraform to provision a VM, assign NSG, and upload an app via DevOps pipeline.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
 Terraform on Azure â€“ Deploy VNets, VMs, AKS, NSGs, Key Vault

 ARM Templates / Bicep (optional)

 YAML templates in Azure Pipelines

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Automate creation of resource groups, VMs, and Key Vault using Terraform via a release pipeline.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Containers & Kubernetes
 Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) â€“ Cluster setup, scaling, RBAC

 Helm â€“ Charts for AKS deployments

 Azure Container Registry (ACR) â€“ Push/pull Docker images

 Docker â€“ Build, tag, run, push locally & via pipelines

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Deploy a containerized app to AKS using a YAML pipeline and Helm chart.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Configuration Management
 Ansible for Azure â€“ Use azure.azcollection for provisioning

 Azure Automation â€“ Schedules, runbooks, PowerShell jobs

 VM Extensions â€“ Install software on provisioned VMs

 Desired State Configuration (DSC) (optional)

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Run Ansible playbook from Azure DevOps agent to configure VMs (e.g., install Nginx).

ðŸ”¹ 6. Monitoring & Logging
 Azure Monitor â€“ Metrics, alerts

 Log Analytics Workspace

 Application Insights â€“ For web apps, APIs

 Azure Alerts â€“ Email, SMS, webhook actions

 Container Insights for AKS

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Set alert rules for CPU > 80% and send to Teams channel via webhook.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Security & Identity
 Azure IAM â€“ RBAC, policies

 Managed Identity â€“ Assign to VMs, AKS, App Services

 Azure Key Vault Access Policies / RBAC

 Conditional Access Policies (optional)

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Securely inject secrets from Key Vault to an Azure pipeline and restrict access by role.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Source Control & GitHub Integration
 GitHub Actions vs Azure Pipelines

 Azure DevOps Repo â†’ GitHub Integration

 Branch policies, code reviews, PR approvals

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Use GitHub Actions to trigger a Terraform workflow that provisions Azure infrastructure.

ðŸ”¹ 9. Release Pipelines (CD)
 Multi-stage YAML vs Classic

 Environment approvals

 Deployment groups for VMs

 CD to AKS, App Services, Function Apps

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Create a release pipeline with manual approval to deploy to UAT and Production.

ðŸ”¹ 10. Automation & Scripting
 Azure CLI

 Azure PowerShell

 Bash / PowerShell scripting in DevOps Pipelines

 Scheduled pipeline triggers

ðŸ“˜ Example Task: Schedule a nightly job to clean unused resources with CLI.
